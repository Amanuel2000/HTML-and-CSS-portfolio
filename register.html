          <p>
            With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries
            I realized that the typical product creation process between clients
            and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate
            to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final
            product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end
            user.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different
            development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and
            transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I
            work to craft the application according to the client's
            specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is
            aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right
            product, delivered on time, and on budget.
          </p>
